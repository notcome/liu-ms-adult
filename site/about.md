# About

I am a citizen of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese.

I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at University of California, San Diego, with a declared major in Linguistics, a planned second major in Mathematics, and a planned minor in Political Science.

I am interested in programming elegantly. As a result my experience and ability of developing real world apps are severely inadequate. I have limited exposure to a variety of programming languages including but not limited to C/C++, C#, Java, ECMAScript, Scheme, Objective-C, and Swift. Obviously I know nothing about Haskell. In fact I have never heard of it.

I am interested in programming languages and computational linguistics. The latter reflects my general interest in *artificial intelligence*. I believe AI is essential to future science advancement, and more powerful development tools are essential to the emergence of any non-trivial AI.

Some less serious matter. I love typography, UI design as well as UX design, and hardware products by Apple. I love sans serif typefaces and dislike serif ones, despite the fact that my favorite typeface is Charter.
